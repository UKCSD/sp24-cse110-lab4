**Part 1:**

Question 1: values added:  20

Question 2: final result:  20

Question 3: values added:  30

Question 4: Error, since result os out of scope due to the definition of `let`

Question 5: Error, since you cannot change the value of a constant variable

Question 6: Error, since you cannot change the value of a constant variable

**Part 2:**

Question 1: 3. The value of `i` will be printed which is the number of times the `for` loop above ran

Question 2: 150. The last `discountedPrice` will be printed

Question 3: 150. The last `finalPrice` will be printed which is just the same as the last `discountedPrice`

Question 4: The function will return the array of discounted prices, but nothing will be printed

Question 5: An error was returned since `i` is out of scope because it is a `let` defined inside of the `for` loop block

Question 6: An error was returned since `discountedPrice` is out of scope because it is a `let` defined inside of the `for` loop block

Question 7: 150 is returned even though `finalPrice` is a `let` but its scope is the entire function block

Question 8: The function will return the array of discounted prices, but nothing will be printed

Question 9: An error is returned since `i` is out of scope since it is a `let`

Question 10: 3 is printed since `prices.length` = 3.

Question 11: The array of discounted prices is returned

Question 12A: Just write `student.name` to access the name property

Question 12B: Use `student['Grad Year']` to access the value of the `Grad Year` property in the `student` object

Question 12C: Use `student.greeting();` to call the function for the `greeting` property in the `student` object

Question 12D: Use `student['Favorite Teacher'].name` to access the `name` property of the object in the `Favorite Teacher` property in `student`

Question 12E: Use `student.courseLoad[0]` to access index zero in the array of the `courseLoad` property of the `student` object

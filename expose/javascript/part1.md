**Part 1:**

Question 1: values added:  20

Question 2: final result:  20

Question 3: values added:  30

Question 4: Error, since result os out of scope due to the definition of `let`

Question 5: Error, since you cannot change the value of a constant variable

Question 6: Error, since you cannot change the value of a constant variable

**Part 2:**

Question 1: 3. The value of `i` will be printed which is the number of times the `for` loop above ran

Question 2: 150. The last `discountedPrice` will be printed

Question 3: 150. The last `finalPrice` will be printed which is just the same as the last `discountedPrice`

Question 4: The function will return the array of discounted prices, but nothing will be printed

Question 5: An error was returned since `i` is out of scope because it is a `let` defined inside of the `for` loop block

Question 6: An error was returned since `discountedPrice` is out of scope because it is a `let` defined inside of the `for` loop block

Question 7: 150 is returned even though `finalPrice` is a `let` but its scope is the entire function block

Question 8: The function will return the array of discounted prices, but nothing will be printed

Question 9: An error is returned since `discountedPrice` is a constant variable which is being assigned a new value and since `finalPrice` is also a constant variable being assigned a new value.
